# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Predictive-Analytics
Predictive analytics project for detecting heart disease using ML models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, and Ensemble Learning.

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies predictive analytics and machine learning to detect the presence of heart disease using clinical data. It explores multiple models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, and an Ensemble Model.

## 📊 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Hybrid Model (Voting Classifier: SVM + LR)

## 🧪 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Heart Disease Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/predicting-heart-disease-risk-using-clinical-var)

## 🔍 Features Used
- Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Max HR, ST Depression, etc.
- Feature selection improved model accuracy from 83.3% to **88.9%**

## 📈 Results Summary

| Model                | Test Accuracy |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | 88.9%         |
| SVM                 | 88.9%         |
| Neural Network      | 88.88%        |
| **Ensemble Model**  | **83.79%**    |

## 🚀 Key Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier removal and feature scaling
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
- Ensemble Learning (VotingClassifier)
